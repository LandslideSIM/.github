# Landslide Simulation Tool

> 🤖 High-performance PINNs tool for landslides simulation.

The study of landslides spans from pre-failure mechanisms to post-failure propagation. The risk posed by landslides often relies more on the latter, and quantitative analysis for it can also describe the hazard caused by landslides more intuitively. The aim of this project is to improve the simulation efficiency and accuracy of research in landslide propagation mechanisms, as well as to make new discoveries that would not be possible using traditional methods alone.

Simulating the run-out process of landslides is more complicated than expected. One of the main issues is that landslide is a complex, non-linear problem that involves a wide range of physical processes, such as rock fragmentation, soil deformation, fluid flow, and multi-physics field coupling. Consequently, we need 1) a good understanding of the physical knowledge, and 2) accurate data from real cases. Furthermore, traditional numerical simulations are computationally intensive. The real cases of landslides will lead to a large-scale computing model, it will take a few days or even more than one week to get the results. Once you want to change some parameters in the model, the whole simulation will start from zero again.

This project has two(three) main parts: 
- **Traditional method**: High-performance landslide post-failure stage simlation based on the Material Point Method
- **NN**:
- **PINN**:
